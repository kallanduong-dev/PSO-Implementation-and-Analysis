Firstly, in the "metrics_weight_adjust_pso_topo_rand_swarm20" combination, the best fitness values show significant variability among the runs. While some runs reach a best fitness of 0, indicating proximity to the global optimum, others fluctuate between 8 and 12. This inconsistency suggests that the interactions between particles and the chosen coefficients and weights may not be well-tuned for optimal performance. Additionally, the distance to the global optimum and standard deviation of particle positions graphs exhibit wide spreads, indicating a lack of stability and convergence. The mean velocity graph shows a similar pattern, with convergence but significant spikes at around 1000 iterations. These observations suggest that the chosen combination may not be effective in achieving consistent and accurate results.
In contrast, the "metrics_weight_adjust_pso_topo_rand_swarm100" combination demonstrates more promising performance. The best fitness values converge slowly but steadily to 0, indicating proximity to the global optimum. The distance to the global optimum graph shows a similar pattern, with runs converging to 0 distance. However, some runs exhibit spikes at around 900 iterations, suggesting potential instability. The standard deviation of particle positions and mean velocity graphs exhibit normal convergence patterns, indicating stable swarm behavior. Overall, this combination shows more reliable convergence and performance compared to the swarm size 20 combination.
The "metrics_weight_adjust_pso_topo_rand_swarm200" combination stands out as the most favorable. The best fitness values converge to 0 without any spikes or fluctuations, indicating stable and accurate solutions. The distance to the global optimum graph also shows convergence to 0 without significant spikes, further supporting the reliability of the results. The standard deviation of particle positions and mean velocity graphs exhibit normal convergence patterns without any abnormal spikes or deviations. This combination demonstrates stable convergence and reliable performance.
Based on these observations, the "metrics_weight_adjust_pso_topo_rand_swarm200" combination would be the preferred choice. It consistently achieves lower best fitness values, faster convergence, and proximity to the global optimum. The stability and reliability of the results make it a suitable choice for practical applications. However, further analysis and experimentation may be necessary to fine-tune the algorithm's coefficients and weights to optimize its performance even further.
In conclusion, the choice of swarm size, weight adjustment, and topology can significantly impact the performance of the PSO algorithm. Careful analysis of the metrics graphs is crucial in evaluating the convergence behavior, proximity to the global optimum, and stability of the swarm. By selecting the most effective combination, researchers and practitioners can enhance the algorithm's performance and achieve better optimization results.
