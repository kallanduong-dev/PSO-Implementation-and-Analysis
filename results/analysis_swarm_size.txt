How variable are the runs for different swarm sizes?
The analysis of the best fitness vs iterations graph shows that for swarm size 20, runs start at 20 best fitness and drop to 1-5 best fitness around 40 iterations. However, only run 6 reaches a best fitness of 0 at iteration 40. For swarm size 100, runs start around 20 best fitness and converge slowly to 0 at around 50 iterations. For swarm size 200, runs start at 17 best fitness and converge to 0 around 30 iterations. There is variability in the convergence behavior among the runs for each swarm size, with some runs reaching the global optimum and others staying at higher fitness values.

How many iterations are needed to converge approximately?
The analysis of the distance to the global optimum vs iterations graph shows that for swarm size 20, runs start at 50 global distance and drop to 0-7 distance to the global optimum. Outlier run 4 stays at 10 distance at iteration 5. For swarm size 100, runs start at 30 distance and converge to around 0 at 25 iterations. For swarm size 200, runs start at 25 distance and all converge to 0 around 20 iterations. The convergence speed varies among the swarm sizes, with swarm size 200 converging faster than swarm size 100, which in turn converges faster than swarm size 20.

Which swarm size gets closer to the global optimum?
Based on the analysis of the best fitness vs iterations graph, swarm size 20 shows runs that reach a best fitness of 0, indicating that they get closer to the global optimum. However, for swarm sizes 100 and 200, all runs converge to a best fitness of 0, suggesting that they get even closer to the global optimum.

Which swarm size converges faster? How might those differences be caused by the swarm size?
The analysis of the mean velocity vs iterations graph shows that for all swarm sizes, the runs converge to 0 mean velocity. However, there are differences in the convergence speed. Swarm size 200 converges faster than swarm size 100, which in turn converges faster than swarm size 20. These differences in convergence speed can be caused by the swarm size affecting the balance between exploration and exploitation. Larger swarm sizes may have more diverse exploration, leading to faster convergence, while smaller swarm sizes may have more focused exploitation around the global optimum.

Which swarm size would you choose?
The choice of swarm size depends on the specific requirements of the problem and the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Swarm size 200 shows faster convergence and all runs reach a best fitness of 0, indicating a closer proximity to the global optimum. However, swarm size 20 also shows runs that reach a best fitness of 0, suggesting that it can also achieve good results. Swarm size 100 falls in between, with slower convergence but still reaching a best fitness of 0. Consider the computational resources available and the desired balance between exploration and exploitation when choosing the swarm size.
