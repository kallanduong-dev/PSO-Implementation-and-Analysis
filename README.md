#About the project
This was a university group project that I completed. We were tasked with designing a library, implementing particle swarm optimisation methods 
and investigating PSO variants. The PSO library is able to solve real valued problem
with different numbers of dimensions (parameters to be optimised) by maximising a fitness
function that characterises the problem. The results of the experiments can be found in the results folder.

# Individual Contribution
Disclaimer: As this was a group project, I did not work on every single part of the following library. My contribution was that I wrote the code in the PSO variants, run_experiments and the topologies files.
