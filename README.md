# PSO-Implementation-and-Analysis
This was a group project completed during university. We were tasked with designing a library to implement a range of particle swarm optimisation methods and
investigating PSO variants. The PSO library is able to solve real valued problems
with different numbers of dimensions (parameters to be optimised) by maximising a fitness
function that characterises the problem. 

# Individual Contribution
Disclaimer: As this was a group project, I did not work on every single part of the following library. My contribution was that I wrote the code in the PSO variants, run_experiments and the topologies files.
