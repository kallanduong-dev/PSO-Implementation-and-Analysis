The provided codebase offers a modular approach to Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a heuristic optimization technique. The architecture is divided into distinct modules, each with a specific responsibility:

Optimization Problems: This module defines optimization challenges. The AckleyFunction class is an example, representing a multi-modal function. This modularity allows for easy addition of other optimization problems.

PSO Variants: Central to the architecture is the PSO implementation. The base PSO class encapsulates core PSO logic, while PSOWithWeight offers a variant with inertia weight adjustments. The Particle class, integral to PSO, represents individual solution candidates.

Topologies: PSO's efficacy often depends on particle interaction topologies. The separate topologies allow particles to share information in various patterns, offering flexibility in swarm behavior.

Metrics and Visualization: To assess and visualize PSO's performance, this module provides plotting functions. It tracks metrics like best fitness and particle velocities, aiding in understanding and fine-tuning the algorithm.

Run Experiments: This module operationalizes the above components. By setting parameters like swarm size and topology, users can run diverse PSO experiments and visualize results.

The architecture's rationale lies in its modularity and separation of concerns. Each module focuses on a singular aspect of PSO, ensuring clarity and ease of modification. This design facilitates scalability, allowing the seamless integration of additional problems, topologies, or PSO variants.
